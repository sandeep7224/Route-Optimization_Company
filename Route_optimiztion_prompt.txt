I want you to write an code in python for route optimizing of field verification officers of a company involved in business of physical property address verification.

The verification process involves a field officer to visit the customer’s property by a scooter and verify the address physically on spot and capture the latitude, longitude at customer’s property.

In this project our main project is that, how a site will be assign to a field officer in optimized way>

for this i have made some rule, which i want you to convert into the working code.

first i want you to understande the database, which is currently saved in a excel.

( first field officer table = F_O_name, F_O_id, Current loaction latitute, current location longitute, idel

Visiting_site_table = request_id, customer_name, property_address, property_latitude, property_longitude, is_high_priority )

In field officer table their is also have the coordinates of the polygon zone, which belongs to them

now i will tell you how exactly the algorithm will works, which means what are the rule, on which the site will be allocate to field officer

Firstly Pick first site from the site_table and calculate the following constraint for every field officer and after them we will decide to whom we will allocate it
 
   A. If the field officer is idle
                If yes give = 0.3
                if not give = 0
                   
   B. If the site belong to the field officer zone, mean the site in within the boundary of the field officer zone or not.
                IF yes give - 0.4
                If not give - 0

   C. Distance from the field officer current location to the site visit location.
                if distance is less than 10 km, then calculate a value according to given formula
                            x = 0.4 - distance_calulate_in_km*0.04
                if the distance is grater then 10 km, give
                            x = 0

   D. Distance the field officer will have to travel after crossing the own zone boundary
                if distance_to_travel is less than 10 km, then calculate a value according to given formula
                            x = 0.2 - distance_calulate_in_km*0.02
                if the distance is greater then 10 km, gives
                            x = 0

After calulating all this thing for every field officer, whose officer value is largest will allocate that site

Please ask any question if needed you to understand anything clearly and after all the doubt clear, then start writting code
